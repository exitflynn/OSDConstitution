# OSDConstitution

## Here lie the rules upon which we may build the greatest and the zaniest OSS community there be:
**0\.** We contribute to cool projects only.

**1\.** If there's something we haven't contributed to, yet, then it isn't *canonically* cool, yet. It could be made cool, by contributing. A list of all the canonically established cool projects is being maintained over at [The Record of the Reals](record-of-reals.md), which at the end of each year shall be added as an entry to [The Realis Open-Sourcia: The Book of Triumphs, Little and Large](we-be-awesome.md) and be finally released as part of the grand annual [Letter of Mercurius](https://github.com/osdc/Mercurius).


**33\.** In any case shall we find more than 10 of ourselves in a foreign communication channel, the [OSDCore Tenants](core-tenants.md) should be upheld, failure to uphold which may lead the members involved directly, or by association, to be [OSDCeased](rituals-and-rites.md). This service of not deviating from the OSDCore Tenants primarily includes, but isn't limited to:

    33.0: https://dontasktoask.com/
    33.1: All external promotional messages are to be taken care of with swiftness.
    33.2: Not to change the group pfp in a manner that it may convey we endorse more than one cat, or any other animal so aptly fitting [the dark triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad) for that matter.
    33.3: Offer help in JavaScript doubts, but with reluctance.
    33.4: Promote our primary communication line a minimum of once every 5 lunar cycles.
    Any inability in upholding these tenants
